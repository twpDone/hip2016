* Blue team
* Red team

#BT Fail
##1
About badges
> You are from computer security ?
Answering *yes* is often a bypass from badges control.
ANd nobody know what you are actually doing

Lessons Learned:
* Cultivate relations ships
* Foster the img of beeing part of a solution, not looking for a problem
* Empower the employees to get involved with what you do

##2
Failure to comunicate

Telnet Drops on FW camed from the inside.
IR team Freaked out
Much time was spended, and the IR guy was quite furious

One technician of his team was doing a test to see how much machines where responsing.

LL : 
1. communication is about listening too
2. .? 
3. .?

You have to plan before, but

#Red Team Fails

##1
> "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face"

Network was Flat, with uncrypted Wifi "guest"
It was **promise land**
> You can't steal if it's given

And the red team refused to do the job because of this point.
That was **wrong**, it was the job to help them by actually showing these problems.

LL:
1. Face the facts that if you're not part of the solution then ...
2. Allies comes in unlikely forms and from unlikely places
3. Short term satisfaction ...?

##2
> THE GAME : You should let the wookie win it

A girl let him come
His compromised 3 computer, then she realised and told the security she failed
He should have stoped here and leaved, but continued  and get caugth

LL:
1. Giving your target a win doesn't dimminish your attack
2. Servers don't respond to an attack with with resentment people do.
3. When you look at the blue team as a teamate and not an adversary you both win !

#Community Fails

##1
> I'm not in danger, i'm the danger

It ok not to like someone, nothing wrong with that.
But others doen't have to be involved. 
You don't have to name people, to say what you don't like, it's better to keep it private.
 
LL:
1. Everyone make mistakes but some have no remorse or desire to correct them
2. Never judge someone more harshly than you want to be
3. ?

##2
> There's a difference between *knowing the path* and **walking the path**

Engage relations with ppl

LL!
1. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be around other who enjoy what you do
2. one of the things of most cons is learning to make sure that's part of it
3. Never forget that just like dentist you're valuable part of the society (and as well known)

> We've all learned lessons !
