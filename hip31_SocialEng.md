#SE
> The ellicitiation of info from systems, networkss or human beings throught methods

* SE as APT is **underestimated**
* Because
    * There's no soft or hardware to fix
    * SE as APT doesn't have it own logo

Stop thinking the human is the weakest link.

Devices mitigate the risk of SE : 
* Talking prevention
* Writing prevention
* Gesture prevention

* **Awareness** is so much better

How do you patch you brain ?

Are vulns without logo less dangerous ( ref : shellshock, heartbleed )

#Help is on a way
Now there's ... // Finally it's dangerous too

#Facts
* Every large attack have SE in it
* Hacking is a business therefore businness principles apply
* From a socioecomomic perspective it's cheaper to hack a person than to evade 2-factor authent

#what are social engineers
Everyone is a way

Normal people : they love
* duck //rubberducky
* turttle //lan turtle
* pinapple //wifi pinapple

Maybe one's running right now ?

#SE
Every data is an assest, if you give something you should get something back. 

1. First don't panic, SE guy is not far
2. Don't remove, you don't know what it does
3. Safely remove, and plug it to your CEO laptop, get the data back
4. Put all the data where they look leaked

Problem with SE : 
* there are not enough
* they have no clearance (PSP)

* Type
* Principle
* Constraints
* Boundaries
